# practice--John-David---Russo-F-
Hi my name's John-David Russo, I go by JD.
I'm from Santa Monica, CA and I went to SAMOHI.
In SPIS, I'm hoping to make new friends and develop more of a foundation in CS, something that I currently lack.
I played French Horn in Orchestra, Band, and Marching Band in highschool.
I love ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, biking, John Williams, and Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, among many other things.
I'm currently in the process of learning both how to drive a motor vehicle and how to surf a board.
This is what I look like:
